# Guardians of the Horde Incursion Fittings

## Battleships
Rule of Thumb: 100k EHP,  70% Shield Resistances.

Travel only with a Scout!
A problem with using BS is that the Refit from Vanguards to Assault can be quite huge. But the buffed cargohold of BS makes it possible to take it with you.

Common T1 Battleships used: Maelstrom, Hyperion, Rokh
